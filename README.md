This project is deprecated and left for reference. While the idea was a good excuse to explore and reimplement parts of the bitcoin protocol, a wiser me now sees the goal that this project was trying to resolve (lessen the difficulty of mining by using PoW to secure local groupings of computation) isn't resolved by using high level PoA and low level PoW. If I pick this project back up, I'd likely pivot to explore alternatives for hash generation to a more benefitical use of computation than simply just securing the network.
