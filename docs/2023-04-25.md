# Blockchain of blockchains :)

PoS for global blockchain
PoW for local blockchains

## Adding a transaction:

1. A user initiates a transaction by creating a digital signature with their private key and broadcasting it to the subchain network.

2. Validators on the subchain network validate the transaction by verifying the digital signature and checking that the sender has sufficient funds to execute the transaction. These validators use PoW consensus to mine new blocks and add them to the subchain.

3. Once the transaction is validated and included in a new block, the subchain broadcasts the new block to the global PoS blockchain network.

4. Validators on the global PoS blockchain network validate the new block by checking that it meets the criteria of the PoS consensus mechanism. If the new block is valid, it is added to the global blockchain.

5. The transaction is now considered confirmed and recorded on the global PoS blockchain, providing a high level of security and immutability.

## Wallets

Wallet address is the hash of the public key.

## Transaction process

1. Initialization: Alice needs to have a wallet that supports the blockchain network and tokens she wants to send. She must also have enough tokens in her wallet address A to cover the amount she wants to send to Bob.

2. Create transaction: Alice creates a transaction that specifies the amount of tokens she wants to send to Bob's wallet address B. The transaction also includes a transaction fee, which compensates the network's validators for including the transaction in the blockchain. Alice's wallet signs the transaction using her private key to prove that she is the owner of the tokens.

3. Broadcast transaction: Alice's wallet broadcasts the signed transaction to the network. The transaction is then propagated to other nodes on the network.

4. Validation: Validators on the network receive the transaction and validate it to ensure that it is correctly formatted and that Alice has enough tokens to cover the transaction amount and fee. The validators also check that Alice's signature is valid and that the transaction has not already been spent.

5. Inclusion in a block: Once the transaction is validated, it is included in a block by a validator who adds it to the blockchain. This block is then added to the blockchain's history, and the transaction is considered confirmed.

6. Confirmation: After a certain number of blocks have been added to the blockchain following the block that contains the transaction, the transaction is considered confirmed. The number of blocks required for confirmation depends on the specific blockchain network and its security protocol.

Once the transaction is confirmed, Bob can see the tokens in his wallet address B, and Alice's wallet address A will show a reduced token balance.
